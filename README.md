# Chadburn - a job scheduler
[![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/PremoWeb%2FChadburn.svg)](https://github.com/PremoWeb/Chadburn/releases) ![Testing Status](https://github.com/PremoWeb/Chadburn/workflows/Testing%20Status/badge.svg)

**Chadburn** is a modern and low footprint job scheduler compatible with Docker environments, written in Go. Chadburn aims to be a replacement for the old fashioned [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).

*** SUMMER 2022 REBUILD ***

The upcoming Chadburn 2.x will be built on the work happening in the summer of 2022 under this summer2022-rebuild branch. It is NOT a working solution and should be treated as such.

I have registered the domain chadburn.app which will serve as the home of the documentation.
